<section class="about">

Welcome! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Political Science](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/) at McGill University. I am affiliated with the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/), the [Centre for Media, Technology, and Democracy](https://www.mediatechdemocracy.com/), and the [Media Ecosystem Observatory](https://www.mediaecosystemobservatory.com/). I specialize in political communication, political behavior, public opinion, and Canadian politics. 

I am particularly interested in how the information citizens are exposed to shapes their attitudes and behaviors. I have mainly conducted research on mis- and disinformation, political microtargeting, the information environnment, perceptions of election integrity, trust, and political polarization. In my research, I rely on a variety of methods, including observational and experimental survey methods, social media analysis, and content analysis (using dictionary-based approaches and manual coding). 

My research has been published in *Party Politics*, the *Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) Misinformation Review*, and the *Elgar Encyclopedia of Technology and Politics*. I also am the co-author of multiple public facing reports. More information about my publications and ongoing research can be found [here](../Research/index.qmd).

I have also provided commentary on the role of mis- and disinformation in Canada in French- and English-language media (radio, television, written), including: 

**In English:** CBC, CTV, Global News, City News, The Canadian Press 

**In French:** Radio-Canada, Le Devoir, 98.5FM, TVA Nouvelles/LCN, Le Journal de Montr√©al, and QUB Radio, among others.

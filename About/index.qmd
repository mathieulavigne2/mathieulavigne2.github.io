<section class="about">

Welcome! 

Welcome! 

I am a SSHRC postdoctoral fellow in the [Program in Quantitative Social Science](https://qss.dartmouth.edu/) at Dartmouth College. I completed, in fall 2023, a Ph.D. in [Political Science](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/){target="_blank"} at McGill University. I specialize in political communication, political behavior, public opinion, Canadian politics, and quantitative methods. 

I am particularly interested in how the information citizens are exposed to shapes their attitudes and behaviors. I have mainly conducted research on mis- and disinformation, political microtargeting, the information environment, perceptions of election integrity, trust, and political polarization. My research builds on a broad range of data, including observational and experimental survey data, news content, web browsing data, and social media data.

My research has been published in *Party Politics*, the *Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) Misinformation Review*, the *Canadian Journal of Political Science* and the *Elgar Encyclopedia of Technology and Politics*. I also am the co-author of multiple public facing reports. More information about my publications and ongoing research can be found [here](./Research/index.qmd){target="_blank"}.

I have provided commentary on the role of mis- and disinformation in Canada's main in French- and English-language media (radio, television, written), including: 

**In English:** CBC, CTV, Global News, City News, The Canadian Press 

**In French:** Radio-Canada, Le Devoir, 98.5FM, TVA Nouvelles/LCN, Le Journal de Montr√©al, and QUB Radio, among others.
